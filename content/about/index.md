# About

This portfolio and blog is my initiative to start sharing my projects, strategies, and insights. There is a vast amount of knowledge available on the web about software development, and to be honest, it can often feel overwhelming.

My goal is to share what works for me—including the tools I use (like A.I.) and other practical tips you can apply. Feel free to explore, and don’t hesitate to reach out if you have something you’d like to accomplish together.

# Bio

I'm a fullstack developer dedicated to **building** fast, scalable web and mobile apps with outstanding user **experiences**.

My main stack includes **Vue.js and Nuxt.js** as my front-end strengths, with additional experience in **React and Next.js**. On the back end, I specialize in **NestJS** and also work with **FastAPI (Python)**. For databases, I have experience with **PostgreSQL and MongoDB**.

This blog is where I share my coding journey—practical tips on everything from AI tools to clean code practices. I'm all about learning in public and adding value to the dev community.

Got an idea or a project? I'd love to connect! Feel free to reach out at my email.

**Happy coding!**
